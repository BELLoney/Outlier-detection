Credit approval data set

Dataset information:
The credit approval data set contains 690 objects with 15 condition attributes, and 1 decision attribute. The condition attributes include 9 categorical attributes and 6 numeric attributes. 37 objects have one or more missing values, which are ignored. The remaining 653 objects are partitioned into 2 classes: ※+§ (296 or 45.33%) and ※-§ (357 or 54.67%). To form an unbalanced distribution, we removed some of the ※+§ objects from the data set. Finally, the relevant data set contains (25 or 6.54%) ※+§ objects and (357 or 93.46%), where we treat ※+§ objects as rare classes with a total of 25 outliers (or rare classes).

Description: The data has been preprocessed and all categorical attributesㄗColumns 1 through 9ㄘ are replaced with different values. The last column is a decision attribute, and the rest are conditional attributes (0 = outliers, 1 = inliers)

Lymphography data set

Dataset information:
It contains 148 objects with 18 condition attributes and 1 decision attribute, where the condition attribute have 3 numerical attributes and 5 categorical attributes. All objects are partitioned into 4 classes: ※normal find§ (2 or 1.35%), ※metastases§ (81 or 54.73%), ※malign lymph§ (61 or 41.22%) and ※fibrosis§ (4 or 2.7%), where ※normal find§ and ※fibrosis§ are regarded as rare classes with a total of 6 outliers.

Wisconsin Breast Cancer data set

Dataset information:
It contains 699 objects with 9 numerical condition attributes and 1 decision attribute. All objects are partitioned into 2 classes: ※benign§ (458 or 65.5%) and ※malignant§ (241 or 34.5%). Herein, we follow the experimental technique of Harkins et al. by removing some of the ※malignant§ objects to form a very unbalanced distribution [78]. The resultant data set had 39 (8%) ※malignant§ objects and 444 (92%) ※benign§ objects. Where ※malignant§ objects are deemed as outliers

Yeast data set 
Dataset information:
It contains 1484 objects, 9 condition attributes, and 1 decision attribute. Herein, 8 numerical attributes and 1 the attribute ※sequence name§ are utilized. All objects are partitioned into 10 classes, and only the ERL class and the first three classes (i.e., CYT, NUC, MIT) are selected. As a result, the ERL class is regarded as a rare class to carry 5 outliers, and the surplus part contains 1136 normal objects.

Annealing data set

Dataset information:
It contains 798 objects, 37 condition attributes, and 1 decision attribute. The condition attributes include 30 categorical attributes and 7 numeric attributes. The 798 objects are partitioned into 5 classes, class 3 carries the largest number of objects, while the remaining classes are treated as rare classes to produce a total of 190 real outliers.
